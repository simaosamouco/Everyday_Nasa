# Everyday_Nasa

 ### Application made for IOS using Swift.
 ### I made this App as an exercise to learn and get better at Swift
 
 #### This is an Application that consumes the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html) where every day new information is available.
 #### Everyday NASA gives us a cool picture and a text talking about the picture and thats exactly what this app is all about.
 #### The point is to open the App once everyday and get your daily dose of awesome astronomy stuff!
 #### Along with that you can also see the objects that are closest to the Earth on that day.
 #### There's also another feature (and my favourite) that allows you to choose a date (all the way to june 16th 1995) and se the picture of that day.
 ##### The app is available in Portuguese and English  with a few bugs here and there and you can also choose if you want the info in miles, km, meters, feet, etc... and this settings are saved in Users Default.
